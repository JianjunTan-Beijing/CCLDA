# CCLDA
prediction of lncRNA-disease associations based on Convolutional Block Attention Module and Capsule Network

The _Code_, _Datasets_ directories contain model codes and tested data sets, respectively. 
The package versions should be followed by users in their environments to achieve the supposed performance.

## Dependency:

python 3.9.16

## Requirement:

numpy==1.22.0    

matplotlib==3.6.3    

torch==1.12.0+cu113    

torch-geometric==2.3.0   

networkx==3.0    

pandas==1.5.3    

scipy ==1.10.0    

scikit-learn==1.2.1

## How to run

The program is in Python 3.9.16 using [Pytorch] backends. Use the below bash command to run CCLDA.
